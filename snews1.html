                <h1>Foreman runs for TD, Bears beat Panthers 16-13 to boost their shot at the top pick in the draft</h1>
                <a href=""><img src="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/24df4bc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4576x3051+0+0/resize/660x440!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1d%2Fad%2Fb29818b80985e28c1ba2b53f8af0%2F2acc3ebca50147bf9040c39ec320675f" alt="Foreman Image"></a>
                <p>CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears weren’t too concerned about appearances. All that mattered was that they came out on top.

                    D’Onta Foreman ran for a touchdown and the Bears boosted their shot at the top pick in the draft, beating the Carolina Panthers 16-13 on Thursday night.
                    
                    “At the end of the day, man, all the hard work we put in, even with it not being pretty it still feels amazing,” Foreman said. “You know what I mean?”</p>

                <p>The prime-time matchup between teams among the bottom five in the NFL delivered about as much drama as expected. But Chicago (3-7) made enough plays to come away with the victory.</p>
                    
                <p>The Bears also boosted their chances at the No. 1 pick because they have Carolina’s first-rounder in 2024. They acquired the pick along with Moore last March for the top selection this year. The Panthers (1-8) are tied with Arizona — which plays Atlanta on Sunday — for the worst record in the NFL.</p>

                <p>Foreman gave the Bears a 16-10 lead in the third quarter with a 4-yard run. Chicago was up by three with 1:40 remaining in the game when Carolina’s Eddy Pineiro missed a 59-yard field goal, the ball landing well short of the goal post. The Bears sealed the win when Darnell Mooney caught an 8-yard pass on third-and-seven at the 48.</p>

                <p>Moore caught five passes for 58 yards against his former team.</p>

                <p>Fields hasn’t played since he exited a Week 6 loss to Minnesota. Eberflus has said repeatedly he remains the Bears’ No. 1 quarterback. But he wouldn’t say if he expects Fields to return next week at Detroit.

                    “We’ll see where it is,” Eberflus said. “It’s a big week to make that evaluation, so we’ll see where it is. When Justin’s healthy, he’ll be our starter.”</p>
            
                <p>Cairo Santos kicked three field goals. The Bears got their pass rush going, sacking Bryce Young three times. It was a big improvement for a team with a league-low 10 through the first nine games.

                    “They got swagger,” said defensive end Montez Sweat, who had three quarterback hits in his second game since a trade-deadline deal from Washington. “All these guys, I really love kind of like the plug and play. I’m really going along with them trying to figure out the energy that they’re bringing.”</p>
