                <h1>Extreme weather, guilt tipping and, yes, Barbie: We’re over you, 2023</h1>
                <a href=""><img src="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a5b5742/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fbf%2F86%2Fd8093dd7ba086fa2733829b5cdb3%2F05214b86f340435f9ba5f95c10b0694c" alt="Barbie Themed Merchandise"></a>
                <p>NEW YORK (AP) — All things Barbie, going pantless, humungo Stanley Cup bottles and pressure tipping. There’s plenty from 2023 to leave behind come the new year.
                    <br><br>
                    Extreme weather hit historic heights. Fakeness took a huge turn with the rise of AI. The rudeness epidemic continued with the help of FaceTime. Here’s a less than all-inclusive list of what we’re over as we look ahead to 2024:
                    </p>

                <p>Barbiecore, aka all things hot pink and playful and hyper-feminine, has been around since the dawn of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino added some high-fashion oomph in 2022 with a buzzy Barbie pink collection. And there’s Nicki Minaj, of course, and her army of fans dubbed the Barbz.
                    <br><br>
                    Then along came Barbenheimer and bam! July 2023 was nuts with the conflation of the films “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” They shared an opening weekend. Big Barbie (and “Oppenheimer”) money was made. It was fun. We needed that feel-good frenzy.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, please, let’s put Babs back in her box and hop on over to some other aesthetic and spot on the color wheel to get all crazy about. Enough with the high profile for our senior gal and her pink. Pink for breast cancer awareness is a whole other story. So is millennial pink, if that ever was an actual thing people generally cared about.</p>
                    
                <p>Kendall Jenner. Hailey Bieber. Ariana Grande. Rihanna. Kim Kardashian. The list goes on of celebs who decided colored but still sheer pantyhose are pants.
                    <br><br>
                    They’re not pants. They’re not tights. They’re not leggings. And they’re definitely not naked dresses, which make some kind of sense on a red carpet or runway for a sheer, sexy vibe.
                    </p>

                <p>There are lots of other ways people go pantless, for sure. Bare legged. Leotarded, like the bedazzled Marc Jacobs number Jenner wore to the Met Gala. All just look like one forgot one’s pants, leaving behind a tuxedo jacket or a long bulky sweater or ill-fitting sweatshirt.
