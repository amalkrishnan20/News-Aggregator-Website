                <h1>Eli Lilly's Zepbound: Here's what to know about new obesity drug approved by FDA</h1>
                <a href=""><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/09/550x309/Obesity-Drug-0_1699550829308_1699550852859.jpg" alt="Lilly Co.OP Image"></a>
                <p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a new obesity drug- Zepbound</p>

                <p>A new drug for obesity falling in the same medication class as Ozempic and Wegovy has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. On Wednesday, November 8, Eli Lilly's tirzepatide medication under the brand name Zepbound was allowed for market sales. The company has already been selling tirzepatide medication for diabetes branded as Mounjaro. Some patients have been using Mounjaro “off-label” for weight loss. However, this will soon no longer be the case as the new weekly injectable drug Zepbound will be available to patients in the US by the end of December.</p>
                    
                <p>How does Zepbound work?</p>

                <p>The active ingredient in Eli Lilly's new drug, which can be administered with an injection pen is the same as its diabetes drug Mounjaro, which is- tirzepatide. It mainly works by mimicking a hormone that helps reduce food cravings. Though Ozempic and Wegovy contain semaglutide, which works the same way in suppressing hunger, trizepatide has a greater advantage when it comes to weight loss. It imitates a second hormone known as GIP, which not only reduces hunger but may also improve the human body's ability to break down sugar and fat. This can substantially increase the chances of weight loss for those dealing with obesity.</p>

                <p>Who can take Zepbound?</p>

                <p>As per the FDA, adults with a body mass index of at least 30, or people with a BMI of 27, or more who suffer from other weight-related conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or obstructive sleep apnea, are eligible for the use of Zepbound. It is advised by FDA that the drug should only be taken in addition to other weight loss-inducing practices such as a reduced calorie diet and exercise, as per NBC News. Moreover, those using Wegovy and Ozempic, or similar GLP-1 agonists should not take Zepbound and vice-versa. The new Eli Lilly's drug is only approved for adults over 18 years whereas, Wegovy is approved for 12 years and over.</p>
