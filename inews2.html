                <p>The 5th India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in Delhi saw a reaffirmation of the ambitious agenda set by US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the White House in June. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined the collaborative efforts between the two nations in fostering economic resilience, ensuring community security, and expanding inclusive economic opportunities.</p>
                    
                <p>“We're harnessing together the power of innovation to make our economies more resilient and to make our communities more secure while expanding inclusive economic opportunity,” the top US diplomat said during the opening remarks at the annual ‘two-plus-two’ talks between the foreign and defence ministers of both countries.</p>

                <p>“Finally, we're deepening the remarkable ties between our people, which is really at the heart of everything. Exploring new educational exchanges, even building steps to facilitate travel between our countries, reducing VISA wait times...When Indians and Americans study together, work together, and collaborate together, the possibilities for progress are infinite,” he added.</p>
